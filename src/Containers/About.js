                    The About Us page of your site is the page where you get to talk about yourself and present how awesome of a person you are.
                     It’s the place that gives you the opportunity to talk about what you do and why it matters.
                     Every successful entrepreneur knows that a well-designed About Us page brings ‘all the boys and gals in the yard’ 
                     which means that it acts as the first point of contact between the ‘creator’ and the ‘receiver’ or else in marketing terms, the ‘seller’ and the ‘buyer’.
